# Tic Tac Toe Game Description
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game designed with an intuitive and interactive user interface. The game allows two players to compete against each other and provides instant feedback on the game’s progress and outcome. Below are the key features:

Game Interface:
The game has a clean and visually appealing layout.
A heading displays the current status of the game, showing which player (Player 1 or Player 2) is making a move.
The game dynamically updates to display the winner's name in the second heading once a player wins.

Gameplay Features:
Players take turns marking their symbol (X or O) on the grid.
The game checks for a winning condition (three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal) and announces the winner.
If the game ends in a draw with no available moves, an alert displays “Draw Game”.

Reset Functionality:
At the bottom of the interface, a Reset button allows players to restart the game at any time.
The reset feature clears the board and restarts the game without refreshing the page.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the game interface.
CSS: For styling the layout and creating a user-friendly design.
JavaScript: For handling game logic, player turns, win/draw detection, and dynamic updates.
